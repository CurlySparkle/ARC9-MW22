# [ARC9] Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II
Weapon pack from [Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II](https://www.callofduty.com/modernwarfare2). There might be a lot of changes here and there in order to keep a proper balance on the weapons so they don't end up being extremely OP and have a better feeling of using them all. 


**Keep in mind, this pack is still a work in progress (WIP).** If you want to make any improvements or better changes, feel free to make a PR (Pull Request).
